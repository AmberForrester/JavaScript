    <h1>Removing negative numbers from an array list using the map( ) method</h1>

    <p>The map ( ) method is primarily used for transforming elements of an array to create a callback function.<br>
        <br>
        It is not the ideal choice for filtering out elements based on a condition like removing negative numbers.<br>
        <br>
        You would use the filter ( ) method instead, but you could combine both methods if you wanted to use map ( ). Together with the filter ( ) method. <br>
        <br>
        As shown in the console log - map ( ) is used to create a new array that's identical to the original one and maintains the original array's length and positions. <br>
        <br>
        By chaining the filter ( ) method to the mapped array. We can filter out only the elements that are greater than or equal to zero, effectively removing the negative numbers. <br>
        <br>
        The filter( ) method on its own works by using this syntax: const positiveNumbers = numbers.filter (num => num >= 0);
